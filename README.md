## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- CSS animations


### Continued development

I have just started studying JS. It is my second project that I practised form validation, the first one you can see [where](https://youthful-stonebraker-6efbf6.netlify.app/) as well as its [repo](https://github.com/isaacnovaes/fylo-dark-theme-landing-page). I am really satisfied with my performance and with how JS can influence web development.
